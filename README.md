Im interested in working with a team that serves to learn all there is to know in order to help protect those who are vulnerable. And provide assistance with account recovery, data recovery etc. 
I want to cooberate new ideas and innovations. I want to invent better ways of security. And to be one of the first bio information systems delivered to society. Preventing scammers. Hackers etc. If access is only allowed via a genetic code. Etc some other standards we cant lose control of our accounts any more.
